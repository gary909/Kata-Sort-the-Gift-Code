        Happy Holidays fellow Code Warriors!<br>
        <br>
        Santa's senior gift organizer Elf developed a way to represent up to 26 gifts by assigning a unique <br>
        alphabetical character to each gift. After each gift was assigned a character, the gift organizer <br>
        Elf then joined the characters to form the gift ordering code.<br>
        <br>
        Santa asked his organizer to order the characters in alphabetical order, but the Elf fell asleep <br>
        from consuming too much hot chocolate and candy canes! Can you help him out?<br>
        <br>
        Sort the Gift Code<br>
        Write a function called sortGiftCode/sort_gift_code/SortGiftCode that accepts a string containing <br>
        up to 26 unique alphabetical characters, and returns a string containing the same characters in <br>
        alphabetical order.<br>
        <br>
        Examples (Input -- => Output):<br>
        "abcdef"                      -- => "abcdef"<br>
        "pqksuvy"                     -- => "kpqsuvy"<br>
        "zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba"  -- => "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"<br>
